The objective is to explore the enrgy consumption for the period of two days. The data set used here is: Electric power consumption. Following plots are constructed as part of intitial analysis:

-Plotting distribution of Global Active Power
-Plotting Global Active Power(kw) over the period of two days
-Plotting Energy Sub-metering over the period of two days
-Multiple plots
