# DataPlotting-Project-1:

### The objective is to explore the energy consumption for the period of two days. The data set used here is: Electric power consumption. The description of the variables is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption. Following plots are constructed as part of initial analysis:

- Plotting distribution of Global Active Power

- Plotting Global Active Power(kw) over the period of two days

- Plotting Energy Sub-metering over the period of two days

- Multiple plots
